## RickRollDucky 

A simple hackducky script to display a message on the user's computer and rick roll them. Also messes with capslock. 

### Demo video (basic features only, as emulator does not support newer versions of duckyscript)

### How to use 
This script needs a physical hackducky to run, but there are tools such as [this](https://github.com/HaydenMeloche/USB-Rubber-Ducky-Toolkit) that can emulate some basic functionalities. <br>
**Using the [emulator](https://github.com/HaydenMeloche/USB-Rubber-Ducky-Toolkit):**
1. Download and unzip the program. Run the executable.
2. Load rickroll_simplified.txt as the duckyscript. (rickroll_simplified has only the basic features that are supported by the emulator.)
3. Validate the script using the "validate" button and remove any whitespace as needed.
4. Run the script.
